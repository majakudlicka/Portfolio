    Hi! My name is Maja Kudlicka and I am a freelance full stack web developer living in London. In May 2017, I graduated
     from a prestigious coding bootcamp Founders & Coders. I have experience working with Javascript, React, Redux,
     Node.js, HTML, CSS, SQL and well as Wordpress.

     I believe in writing readeable, maintenable code, agile practice and test-driven development.

     I have been a coding mentor in Gaza, London and Nazareth.

     Apart from coding, my main interests include food, drink and sleep.
