       BEEVR is an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) of the application for a Cambridge-based start-up that connects students- that have a little
       extra time on their hands and need some extra cash; with local residents - that need help with various ad-hoc tasks.
       The MVP was built using modern React and Redux; making the structure very scaleable and the rendering fast. We worked using agile methodology.

       The design is mobile-first; however it is possible to access the app on desktop as well.

       We have received positive feedback from the Product Owner saying that having the MVP was extremely useful in
       his conversations with potential investors.
